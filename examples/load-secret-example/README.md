# Basic Example

Demonstrates how to use a hook to react a gcloud secret and insert it into the app's environment

Note: The contents will only be inserted into versions deployed to Google Cloud. To run locally (which won't demonstrate much), set the environment variable manually in `.env.development`.

## Features

- Displays the current app version and the client-safe elements in the secret

## Setup

See ../README.md for setup instructions.
